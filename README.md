The system applies the main Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to create a clean and organized design. Encapsulation is used by keeping class attributes private and accessing them through methods to protect data. Abstraction is implemented using an abstract User class to represent common properties without exposing implementation details. Inheritance allows the Employee class to reuse properties from the User class, reducing code duplication. Polymorphism is supported through parent–child relationships, allowing flexibility for future extensions. In addition, enums are used to define fixed values such as roles and leave statuses, which helps prevent invalid inputs and makes the system safer and easier to maintain.
