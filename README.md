The system applies Object-Oriented Programming principles by using interfaces, an abstract parent class, and multiple child classes. Interfaces act as contracts that define required methods for payroll calculation and system operations. The abstract Employee class serves as a template that contains shared attributes and methods, reducing code duplication. Encapsulation is implemented by keeping attributes private and accessing them through getters and setters. Inheritance allows different user types such as HR, Finance, IT, and Admin to extend the parent class and reuse its properties. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding, where each user type provides its own implementation of required methods. Overall, this structure makes the system organized, scalable, and easier to maintain.
